If you've forked the Academic Pages template for your GitHub Pages website and want to add a commenting system, Giscus is an excellent choice. This guide will walk you through setting up Giscus comments on your Academic Pages website.

## What is Giscus?

Giscus is a comments system that uses GitHub Discussions to store comments. When someone comments on your blog post, it actually creates a discussion in your GitHub repository. The main advantages are:
- Free and open source
- No ads
- No external database needed
- Spam protection (since commenters need GitHub accounts)
- Comments are stored in your repository

## Prerequisites

1. Your repository must be public
2. GitHub Discussions must be enabled in your repository
3. You have forked the Academic Pages template and have it running

## Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. Enable GitHub Discussions

First, enable GitHub Discussions in your repository:
1. Go to your repository settings
2. Scroll down to the "Features" section
3. Check the box next to "Discussions"

### 2. Install Giscus GitHub App

1. Go to [https://github.com/apps/giscus](https://github.com/apps/giscus)
2. Click "Install"
3. Select your repository and complete the installation

### 3. Configure Giscus

1. Visit [https://giscus.app](https://giscus.app)
2. In the configuration section:
   - Enter your repository name (e.g., `username/username.github.io`)
   - Choose "pathname" for Page ↔️ Discussions Mapping
   - Enable "Use strict title matching"
   - Choose "Announcements" as the Discussion Category
   - Select your preferred theme (e.g., "light")
   - Select other options as desired (reactions, lazy loading, etc.)

Make note of the following values from the generated script:
- `data-repo`
- `data-repo-id`
- `data-category`
- `data-category-id`

### 4. Update _config.yml

Modify your `_config.yml` file to use Giscus. Find the comments section and update it:

```yaml
comments:
  provider: "custom"
  giscus:
    repo: "username/username.github.io"  # Your repository name
    repo_id: "R_xxx"                     # Your repository ID
    category: "Announcements"            # The discussion category
    category_id: "DIC_xxx"              # The category ID
    mapping: "pathname"
    strict: true
    reactions_enabled: '1'
    theme: "light"
    language: "en"
    loading: "lazy"
```

### 5. Add Giscus Script

Locate the file `_includes/comments-providers/custom.html` and replace its contents with:

```html
<!-- start custom comments snippet -->
{% if site.comments.giscus %}
  <div id="giscus-comments">
    <script src="https://giscus.app/client.js"
        data-repo="{{ site.repository }}"
        data-repo-id="{{ site.comments.giscus.repo_id }}"
        data-category="{{ site.comments.giscus.category }}"
        data-category-id="{{ site.comments.giscus.category_id }}"
        data-mapping="pathname"
        data-strict="1"
        data-reactions-enabled="{{ site.comments.giscus.reactions_enabled }}"
        data-emit-metadata="0"
        data-input-position="bottom"
        data-theme="{{ site.comments.giscus.theme }}"
        data-lang="en"
        data-loading="lazy"
        crossorigin="anonymous"
        async>
    </script>
    <div class="giscus"></div>
  </div>
{% endif %}
<!-- end custom comments snippet -->
```

### 6. Enable Comments on Posts

To enable comments on a specific blog post, add `comments: true` to the front matter of your post:

```yaml
---
title: 'Your Blog Post Title'
date: 2024-01-01
permalink: /posts/2024/1/blog-post-1/
comments: true
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
```

Note: By default, the Academic Pages template enables comments for all posts in `_config.yml` under the defaults section:

```yaml
defaults:
  # _posts
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: posts
    values:
      layout: single
      author_profile: true
      read_time: true
      comments: true  # This line enables comments for all posts
      share: true
      related: true
```

If you want to disable comments for a specific post, you'll need to explicitly set `comments: false` in that post's front matter.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Comments not appearing?**
   - Check if GitHub Discussions is enabled
   - Verify your repository name and IDs in `_config.yml`
   - Make sure the post has `comments: true` (or is not explicitly set to false)

2. **Error in loading comments?**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify the Giscus app is installed on your repository
   - Make sure your repository is public

3. **Comments appearing on unwanted pages?**
   - Check your `_config.yml` defaults section
   - Add `comments: false` to specific posts or pages where you don't want comments

## Additional Notes

- Comments are stored as GitHub Discussions in your repository
- Users need a GitHub account to comment
- You can moderate comments through GitHub's interface
- The theme will automatically match your website's theme
- Comments are loaded lazily to improve page performance
