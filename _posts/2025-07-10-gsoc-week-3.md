## Introduction

SU2 is an open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software suite widely used by researchers and engineers to simulate complex fluid flow problems. As part of my Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project, I am focused on improving the MLPCpp submodule within SU2, which integrates machine learning techniques to enhance CFD simulations. To achieve meaningful performance improvements, I required a profiling tool capable of providing detailed insights into execution time and resource utilization. While Valgrind is a well-known profiler, its significant overhead makes it less suitable for large-scale simulations. This led me to adopt Tracy, a real-time, nanosecond-resolution profiler with minimal overhead and an intuitive interface. In this blog post, I outline the process of integrating Tracy with SU2 and demonstrate its application in profiling my GSoC work.

## What is Tracy?

Tracy is a high-performance profiler designed for C++ applications, offering real-time profiling with exceptionally low overhead. Unlike Valgrind, which can drastically slow down execution, Tracy is optimized for use in production environments, making it ideal for performance analysis in computationally intensive applications like SU2. Key features include:

- Real-time visualization of profiling data.
- Nanosecond-resolution timing for precise measurements.
- Customizable instrumentation for targeted profiling.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) for analyzing results.

For a deeper dive into Tracy’s capabilities, refer to the [Tracy documentation](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/latest/download/tracy.pdf).

## Setting Up Tracy with SU2

Integrating Tracy with SU2 involves three main steps: installing the client, setting up the server, and instrumenting the code. Below, I detail the process based on my setup: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS, SU2 v8.2.0 ("Harrier"), Meson build system (≥0.61.1), and Git.

### Client Installation

The "client" refers to the Tracy library embedded within the SU2 executable, responsible for collecting profiling data during runtime. To integrate it into SU2 using Meson, follow these steps:

1. **Create a wrap file for Tracy:**
   - Navigate to the SU2 directory: `cd SU2`.
   - Create a file named `subprojects/tracy.wrap` with the following content:
     ```ini
     [wrap-git]
     url = https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy.git
     revision = master
     depth = 1
     ```

2. **Update Meson options:**
   - Edit `meson_options.txt` (or `meson.options`) to add:
     ```meson
     option('tracy_enable', 
            type: 'boolean', 
            value: false, 
            description: 'Enable Tracy profiling support')
     ```

3. **Modify the main Meson build file:**
   - In `meson.build`, add Tracy as a dependency when enabled:
     ```meson
     if get_option('tracy_enable')
         tracy_dep = dependency('tracy', static: true)
         su2_deps += tracy_dep
         su2_cpp_args += '-DTRACY_ENABLE'
         
         if get_option('buildtype') != 'debugoptimized'
             warning('For optimal Tracy profiling, use --buildtype=debugoptimized')
         endif
     endif
     ```
   - Update the default options at the top:
     ```meson
     default_options: ['buildtype=release',
                       'warning_level=0',
                       'c_std=c99',
                       'cpp_std=c++11',
                       'tracy_enable=false']
     ```
   - Enhance the configuration summary:
     ```meson
     message('''
     ...
     Tracy Profiler: @0@
     ...
     '''.format(get_option('tracy_enable')))
     ```

4. **Build SU2 with Tracy:**
   - Ensure Meson is up-to-date (I encountered issues with an older version and upgraded it):
     ```bash
     pip install --user --upgrade meson
     ```
   - Configure and build SU2:
     ```bash
     ~/.local/bin/meson build_tracy -Dwith-mpi=disabled -Denable-pywrapper=true -Denable-mlpcpp=true --buildtype=debugoptimized -Dtracy_enable=true --prefix=/home/user/SU2_install
     ./ninja -C build_tracy install ARGS='-j8'
     ```
   - Adjust the `--prefix` path to your desired installation directory.

This process embeds the Tracy client into SU2, preparing it for profiling.

### Server Installation

The "server" is the Tracy profiler application that visualizes the data collected by the client. To set it up:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   - On Ubuntu, install the required libraries:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev libcapstone-dev libdbus-1-dev \
     libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev wayland-protocols \
     libegl1-mesa-dev libglvnd-dev \
     libgtk-3-dev
     ```

2. **Build the Tracy profiler:**
   - Navigate to the Tracy directory: `cd ~/SU2/subprojects/tracy`.
   - Use CMake to build the profiler:
     ```bash
     cmake -B profiler/build -S profiler -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLEGACY=ON
     cmake --build profiler/build --config Release --parallel
     ```
   - Note: I used `-DLEGACY=ON` for X11 support due to compilation issues with Wayland, though this is not the recommended approach.

The Tracy server is now ready to visualize profiling data.

### Instrumenting the Code

To gather useful profiling data, the SU2 code must be instrumented with Tracy macros. For my GSoC project, I focused on profiling the `Predict_MLP` function in the `CDataDrivenFluid` class. Here’s how to do it:

1. **Include the Tracy header:**
   - Add at the top of the source file:
     ```c++
     #include <tracy/Tracy.hpp>
     ```

2. **Add profiling macros:**
   - Instrument the function with `ZoneScopedN`:
     ```c++
     unsigned long CDataDrivenFluid::Predict_MLP(su2double rho, su2double e) {
         ZoneScopedN("Predict_MLP");
         unsigned long exit_code = 0;
         // Function implementation
         return exit_code;
     }
     ```
   - The `ZoneScopedN("name")` macro labels the profiling zone, making it identifiable in the Tracy GUI.

Repeat this process for other functions or sections you wish to profile.

## Using Tracy for Profiling

With the client and server set up and the code instrumented, profiling SU2 is straightforward:

1. **Launch the Tracy profiler:**
   - Navigate to the profiler build directory:
     ```bash
     cd ~/SU2/subprojects/tracy/profiler/build
     ```
   - Run the profiler:
     ```bash
     ./tracy-profiler
     ```
   - Click "Connect" in the GUI; it will wait for a connection from SU2.

2. **Execute the instrumented SU2 simulation:**
   - In a separate terminal, navigate to your simulation directory and run:
     ```bash
     /home/user/SU2_install/bin/SU2_CFD config_NICFD_PINN.cfg
     ```
   - Replace the path and configuration file as needed.

As the simulation runs, Tracy displays real-time profiling data. The GUI allows you to explore performance metrics, identify bottlenecks, and optimize code effectively.

## Conclusion

Using Tracy to profile my SU2 code has been a game-changer for my GSoC project. Its low overhead and real-time visualization have enabled me to pinpoint performance issues in the MLPCpp submodule with precision. By following the steps outlined above, you can integrate Tracy into your own SU2 projects and leverage its capabilities for performance analysis. For advanced features and troubleshooting, consult the [Tracy documentation](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy/releases/latest/download/tracy.pdf). I encourage you to explore Tracy and enhance your CFD workflows.
