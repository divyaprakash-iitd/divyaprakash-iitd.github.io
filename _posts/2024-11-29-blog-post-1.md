When trying to install OpenFOAM on Ubuntu/Debian systems behind a proxy server (especially institutional proxies), users often encounter SSL connection issues. This guide provides a step-by-step solution to successfully install OpenFOAM in such environments.

## Common Issues

When running the standard installation command:
```bash
wget -q -O - https://dl.openfoam.com/add-debian-repo.sh | sudo bash
```

Users behind proxies might encounter errors like:
```
Proxy tunneling failed: Moved Temporarily
Unable to establish SSL connection.
```

Even after setting proxy environment variables:
```bash
export http_proxy="http://your.proxy.address:port"
export https_proxy="http://your.proxy.address:port"
```

The installation might still fail due to SSL verification issues with the proxy server.

## Solution: Manual Installation Process

Here's a reliable workaround that involves downloading the required files from a computer with direct internet access and then transferring them to the target computer.

### Step 1: On a Computer with Direct Internet Access

1. Download the OpenFOAM GPG key:
```bash
wget https://dl.openfoam.com/pubkey.gpg
```

2. Download the repository script (optional but useful for reference):
```bash
wget https://dl.openfoam.com/add-debian-repo.sh
```

3. Transfer these files to your target computer using a USB drive, SCP, or any other file transfer method.

### Step 2: On the Target Computer (Behind Proxy)

1. Convert and install the GPG key:
```bash
# Convert the key to the correct format and install it
cat pubkey.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/openfoam.gpg
```

2. Add the OpenFOAM repository:
```bash
# Add the repository entry
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture)] https://dl.openfoam.com/repos/deb $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
    sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/openfoam.list
```

3. Update the package lists:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

### Step 3: Verify the Installation

You can verify that the key is properly installed by running:
```bash
apt-key list
```

You should see the OpenFOAM key listed without any "unsupported filetype" warnings.

### Step 4: Install OpenFOAM

Now you can proceed with installing OpenFOAM:
```bash
sudo apt-get install openfoam
```

## Troubleshooting

1. If you see "unsupported filetype" warnings after adding the key, ensure you used the `gpg --dearmor` command to convert the key file.

2. If `apt-get update` fails, verify your proxy settings:

```bash
# Set your proxy details
export http_proxy="http://your.proxy.address:port"
export https_proxy="http://your.proxy.address:port"

# Try updating again
sudo -E apt-get update
```

3. If you're still having issues, check your proxy configuration in `/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/`:

```bash
# Create or edit proxy configuration
sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/proxy.conf

# Add these lines (replace with your proxy details):
Acquire::http::Proxy "http://your.proxy.address:port";
Acquire::https::Proxy "http://your.proxy.address:port";
```

## Notes

- This method works for most institutional and corporate proxy servers where direct SSL connections might be intercepted or blocked.
- The solution maintains security by using the official OpenFOAM GPG key.
- This approach can be adapted for other software packages that face similar proxy-related installation issues.
