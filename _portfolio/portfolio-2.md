## Overview
Developed a sophisticated fluid-structure interaction simulator using the Lattice Boltzmann Method. The code models the complex dynamics of a falling elliptical cylinder in a channel, capturing both translational and rotational motion while considering fluid forces and torques.

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented D2Q9 Lattice Boltzmann Method for fluid flow simulation
- Developed robust boundary handling for moving solid objects
- Created real-time visualization of flow fields
- Achieved efficient computation through vectorized MATLAB operations
- Generated publication-quality output for scientific visualization

## Impact
The simulator provides a valuable tool for studying fluid-structure interaction problems, particularly useful in engineering applications involving particle-laden flows, sediment transport, and industrial processes with suspended objects.

## Skills Demonstrated
